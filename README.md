# Airline-Project-CPP-OOP
C++ OOP Project I had to deliver in my course

Practicing all the OOP principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism).

Writing/reading from files, handling different exceptions and more.

For the project we got a pre-made main.cpp file and had to build all the classes (source and header files) in order to make it run and get a specific output.
